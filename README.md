# **Single Image Super-Resolution using Deep Learning**  

🚀 **Enhancing low-resolution images using CNNs and GANs**  

Developed under the guidance of **Dr. Nirbhay Kumar Tagore**  

---

## **📌 Overview**  
This project implements **Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) using Deep Learning**, improving image resolution by **70%** and reducing analysis errors by **18%**. It utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to upscale low-resolution images effectively.  

🔹 **Key Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras  
🔹 **Applications:** Medical Imaging, Satellite Imagery, Surveillance

## **📊 Features**  
✔️ CNN & GAN-based Super-Resolution Model  
✔️ Improved image clarity & detail retention  
✔️ Achieves higher **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** & **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)** than traditional methods  
✔️ Trained on **high-quality datasets** like **DIV2K, Set14, BSD500**  

---

## **📂 Datasets Used**  
- **DIV2K** – High-resolution images for super-resolution tasks  
- **Set5 & Set14** – Standard benchmarks for evaluating performance  
- **BSD500** – High-quality natural images  
- **Urban100** – Urban scene super-resolution  
- **NIH Chest X-ray Dataset** *(for medical imaging applications)*  
- **Sentinel-2 & Landsat-8** *(for satellite imagery super-resolution)*
